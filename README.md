# 2levelatom
Forward solver and inversion of the I-Q stokes parameters for a 2 level atom in a constant properties atmosphere

The forward solver is done with the Accelerated Lambda iteration and the inversion with the LM minimization.
A Bayesian implementation has also been developed.

The codes are in Python and in C as well as a integration of C into python.
